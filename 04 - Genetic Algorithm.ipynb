    "# Genetic Algorithm\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "Genetic algorithm simulates the natural selection. At each step, the genetic algorithm selects individuals from the current population to be parents and uses them to produce the children for the next generation. Over successive generations, the population evolves toward an optimal solution. Like natural selection, this algorithm also has crossover to create new individuals and mutation to apply random changes to individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fitness score\n",
    "The fitness score show how well fit an individual is. The individuals having better fitness score have higher chance to be parents in the next reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each new generation has on average more “better genes” than the individual (solution) of previous generations. Thus each new generations have better “partial solutions” than previous generations. Once the offspring produced having no significant difference from offspring produced by previous populations, the population is converged. The algorithm is said to be converged to a set of solutions for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operators of genetic algorithm\n",
    "- **Selection operator**: Genetic algorithm randomly selects 2 individuals for reproduction. For more realistic, the probability of being chosen is proportional to the fitness score.\n",
    "- **Crossover**: After selecting parents, the algorithm randomly choose a crossover point, then exchange the genes.\n",
    "- **Mutation Operator**: The algorithm randomly choose a part of genes and changes. This is when new unique genes are created and prevents the population from premature.\n",
    "## Explanation\n",
    "### Individual Class\n",
    "For simpler explanation, we build a class called individual to contain the gene and fitness score:\n",
    "- Gene is an array containing bits, 0 for not choosing and 1 is choosing the item\n",
    "- Fitness score is an integer showing how well the individual is fit to problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "CLASS Individual\n",
    "    PUBLIC gene\n",
    "    PUBLIC fitness\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The fitness score is calculated by a private method. We uses a sett called class set to store unique classes of items when choosing. If the item is chosen, we add its weight to current weight. And if the current weight is more than the capacity of the backpack, we return 0 as this individual is not fit the problem. Then, we add its class to classSet and its value to current value. Finally, if our class set has *m* unique number, which means we choose enough classes, we return the value and 0 if otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "private FUNCTION calculateFitness\n",
    "    RETURNS fitness score\n",
    "    class set <- empty\n",
    "    current weight, current value <- 0,0\n",
    "    FOR i=0 TO size(gene) DO\n",
    "        IF (gene[i]=0) CONTINUE\n",
    "        current weight = current weight + w[i]\n",
    "        IF (current weight > capacity) RETURN 0\n",
    "        class set ADD c[i]\n",
    "        current value = current value + v[i]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    IF (number value in class set >= number classes) RETURN value\n",
    "    ELSE RETURN 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Selection Operator\n",
    "This operator is used to select parent from the population. For more realistic to natural, the fitter the individual is, the higher change it is chosen to become parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we find the total fitness score of population and call that value max. If max is 0, that means no individual is fit the problems, we can return any individual in population. Next, the probability of being chosen is calculated by $p = \\frac{fitness}{max}$. Finally, we return an individual in population that randomly chosen with probability of being chosen\n",
    "\n",

    "    RETURNS individual that become parent\n",
    "    max <- 0\n",
    "    FOR i=0 TO SIZE(population) DO\n",
    "        max = max + population[i].fitness\n",
    "\n",
    "    IF (max = 0) RETURN an individual in population that randomly chosen\n",
    "\n",
    "    selection props <- empty list\n",
    "    FOR i=0 TO SIZE*population DO\n",
    "        selection props APPEND population[i].fitness/max\n",
    "\n",
    "    RETURN an individual in population that randomly chosen with probability of being chosen in selection props\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crossover Operator\n",
    "After selecting two parents, we randomly choose a cross point. Then, we replace a part of gene of first parent with part of gene of second parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "FUNCTION crossover (p1, p2)\n",
    "    RETURNS an individual\n",
    "    p1 gene, p2 gene <- p1.gene, p2.gene\n",
    "    cross point is randomly chosen with value between 0 and SIZE(p1 gene)-1\n",
    "    new gene = p1[0 .. cross point] APPEND p2[cross point+1 .. SIZE(p2 gene)-1]\n",
    "    RETURN an individual with gene is new gene    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutation Operator\n",
    "For each bits of choice, there is a chance that it will change.\n",
    "\n",
    "We loop through the gene, and with a probability to have mutation, we may change that bit\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "FUNCTION mutation(individual)\n",
    "    RETURNS an individual\n",
    "    FOR i=0 TO SIZE(individual.gene) DO\n",
    "        IF (this bit is chosen to be changed)\n",
