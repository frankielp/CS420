Then we iterate through the list of subset and check whether its total value is better than the current highest value while keeping the total weight smaller or equal the bounded weight. In addition, for each subset that have the probability to be chosen as result, which means it has better total value and accepted total weight, we also check the additional constraint given in the problem, which is whether the subset contains all classes or not.

    "### Description\n",
    "The Genetic Algorithm simulates natural selection. At each step, the Genetic Algorithm chooses members of the current population to act as parents and uses them to create children for the following generation. The population evolves in the direction of an ideal solution over successive generations. Like natural selection, this algorithm also has crossover to create new individuals and mutation to apply random changes to individuals."

    "The fitness score shows how well-fit an individual is. The individuals having better fitness scores have a higher chance to be parents in the next reproduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average number of \"better genes\" in a new generation is higher than it was in the generation before it. As a result, new generations always have more effective \"partial solutions\" than earlier ones. The population has converged once there are no discernible differences between the progeny and those of earlier populations. It is claimed that the algorithm is changed into a collection of answers to the issue."

If the item is chosen, we add its weight to the current weight. Additionally, we return 0 if the person's weight exceeds the backpack's carrying capacity because they are not a good fit for the problem. Then, its value is added to the current value and its class is added to the class set. Finally, we return the value and 0 otherwise if our class set contains m distinct numbers, indicating that we selected enough classes."

Any member of the population may be returned if the maximum is $0$, which indicates that no individual is fit for the problem.

    "\n",
    "For each generation, we create a set called the new population to store distinct individuals of the new population. We choose two parents for each generation, perform crossover to produce a child, and perform mutation to produce a new gene. After creating a new child, we add it to a new population and it may become the best individual if the fitness score of the child is greater. We do this process several times, in this report is the number of individuals in the current population, and assign the population as an array of the new population for the next generation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The number of initial individuals does not have too many effects since it only has more parents which gives more chances to find the best individual early. However, as more generations are produced, we may be able to find individuals who are fitter as we may be able to obtain genes that contain portions of the solution and use those components to produce a really good solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most ideal implementation is utilizing a single population. We add a new child to the population set at a new generation until the size is not changing. However, this is not realistic since the size of the population is $2^n$, where $n$ is the number of items, which is too large to store in a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also make a few small adjustments. To maintain population diversity, the crossover operation can bring back two additional children. We can also eliminate the bad individuals, for example, the fitness score is $0$. However, we discover that this is unwise since those individuals may contain good parts."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Despite the fact that Brute Force is straightforward to use and will always discover a solution if one exists, implementation costs are positively correlated with the number of candidate solutions, which in many real-world situations tends to increase rapidly as the problem's size rises. As a result, it is commonly utilized when the issue size is small or when there are heuristics available to reduce the number of alternative solutions to a reasonable number. When simplicity of implementation is more essential than speed, the approach is also employed. For problems that have quite a number of candidates, it is recommended to use a more effective algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of the Branch and Bound Algorithm significantly relies on a suitable heuristic function for the search space's branch boundaries. The procedure degenerates into an exhaustive search if bounds are not supplied. Branch and Bound can rapidly and efficiently arrive to the answer with the right heuristic function, though. Consequently, it may be stated that this method successfully solves issues, particularly those involving optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Genetic Algorithm is simple and fast since the core of this algorithm is random and it runs in almost constant time. Because it is based on natural phenomena, the result is not optimal but acceptable. Hence, it is good when solving a hard problem or a problem with a large state space."
